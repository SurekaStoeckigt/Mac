Airport Challenge
=========================

This was my Python attempt at the Makers Academy week 2 Airport Challenge (see the proper Ruby version [here](https://github.com/gwpmad/airport_challenge)).

I did this during Week 6, the 'lab week' where we were free to work on our own projects. This simple object-oriented airport should be run via the Python REPL (run the `python` terminal command and cd into this project's `lib` folder, where the code is located, then type `from airport import *`.

Most of the other files in this project are unused; I was experimenting with Python file structure and used [this template](https://github.com/seanfisk/python-project-template).
